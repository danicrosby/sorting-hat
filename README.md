## Optional Bonus
- House Colors: The color of the student's card changes depending on which house they were sorted. 
- Card Ordering: Sort the student cards by some criteria (i.e. alphabetically by name, by house)
- Voldermort's Army: Create a separate container of cards that hold the cards for students that have been expelled. These should be styled differently from Hogwarts students.

PROJECT NAME: Harry Potter Sorting Hat


PROJECT OVERVIEW: 
This is what the finished app should have:
To have the sorting hat introduce itself and start the sorting process by clicking on a button. A form will appear to input student's name to sort in a random Hogwarts house. On sorting a student, the form should clear and a card with the student and random house will be printed to the DOM and a button on the card to expel a student after they have been sorted.

Houses are: (Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, Slytherin or Voldemort's Army).
